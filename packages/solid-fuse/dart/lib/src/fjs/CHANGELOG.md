# Changelog

## 2.2.0

* **BREAKING**: Renamed runtime and engine factory APIs from `withOptions(...)` to `create(...)`
* **BREAKING**: Renamed factory parameters from `builtin`/`additional` to `builtins`/`modules`
* **FEATURE**: Added `JsEngineRuntimeOptions` for engine-owned runtime limits and metadata during construction
* **FEATURE**: Added runtime control proxies on `JsEngine`, including memory, GC, stack, scheduler, and info APIs
* **FIX**: Kept `JsEngine` as the sole owner of its runtime/context while restoring access to runtime-level safety controls
* **FIX**: Corrected engine integration tests to validate engine-owned runtime behavior instead of unrelated standalone runtimes
* **FIX**: Restored and expanded lifecycle regression coverage for engine initialization and close state transitions
* **DOCS**: Updated README, README_zh, FRB-generated API docs, and example app code to the final `create(...)` API
* **INTERNAL**: Regenerated Flutter Rust Bridge bindings with `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen 2.12.0`
* **INTERNAL**: Cleaned remaining Rust test warnings caused by unused async test contexts

## 2.1.0

* **BREAKING**: Renamed `clearNewModules()` to `clearPendingModules()` to match its actual semantics; only not-yet-loaded dynamic modules can be cleared
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Upgraded LLRT dependencies to revision `a2e1640`
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added more LLRT-backed runtime capabilities, including `dgram`, `https`, `intl`, and `temporal`
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added module inventory APIs to inspect all available modules, including builtins and additional configured modules
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Clarified dynamic module lifecycle with `clearPendingModules()`, which only clears not-yet-loaded registrations
* **FEATURE**: Added QuickJS bytecode APIs for ES modules, module bundles, and classic scripts, with compile, validate, declare, and evaluate workflows
* **FIX**: Moved bytecode compile and validate onto generated FRB APIs outside `JsEngine`, with both sync and async variants
* **FIX**: Made module bytecode compilation side-effect free and added eager bytecode validation before declaration/evaluation
* **FIX**: Prevented redefinition of dynamically loaded modules inside the same context lifecycle
* **FIX**: Corrected relative resolution for dynamically declared modules
* **FIX**: Hardened `JsEngine` lifecycle with an explicit initializing state, so `running` only becomes true after successful initialization
* **FIX**: Stabilized `dispose()` semantics to detach the bridge, drain pending runtime work, run GC, and leave ownership of the underlying context/runtime unchanged
* **FIX**: Rejected duplicate module names in bulk `declareNewModules()` and `declareNewBytecodeModules()` requests instead of silently overriding entries
* **FIX**: Hardened `JsValue` conversions for `Date`, `BigInt`, safe integers, and typed arrays
* **FIX**: Removed implicit runtime draining from hot execution paths; pending jobs now advance only through explicit runtime APIs
* **DOCS**: Updated README, README_zh, generated API docs, and example code to match the current production API and module semantics

## 1.4.0

* **BREAKING**: Restructured API modules - removed deprecated `js` module, added `engine`, `error`, `runtime`, and `source` modules for better organization
* **FIX**: Fixed Promise result unwrapping - QuickJS's `JS_EVAL_FLAG_ASYNC` wraps Promise results in `{value: xxx}` format, now properly detected and unwrapped by checking for objects with exactly one `value` property
* **FIX**: Fixed nested Promise handling to correctly await and unwrap chained Promises
* **FIX**: Fixed `undefined` value handling in Promise results - now correctly returns `JsValue.none()` instead of the wrapper object
